\section {TURNING COST OF MULTICOPTER}

\subsection{MODEL}

Model for efficiency of a quad rotor. Some possible sources are \cite{driessens2013}.


\subsection{EXPERIMENTS}

Due to the high variability of a quadrotor's configuration, such as the efficiency curves of the motors used, we will measure the energy used during turning of our hexacopter directly.
To comply with our algorithm's grid base approach, we will measure the energy used by our hexacopter as it travels over three equal-sized grids in flight. See Fig.~\ref{fig:gridturn}.

To measure the energy cost, we use a Raspberry Pi with an ADC logging chip to log the voltage accross and current through the battery of our hexacopter during flight.
This log can then be synchronized with the GPS log recorded by our quadcopter during the flight.
