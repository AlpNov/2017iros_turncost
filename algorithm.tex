\section {OUR ALOGRITHM}

\subsection {The algorithm}

Need to explain which algorithm/heuristic we are using.

\subsection {Experimental data}

Find the area sweeped out by the UAV in its path.
Compare our algorithm/path against a boustrophedon path trying to cover the same area, or a square spiral.
